## Notes

I had a few challenges with the git section of the prework. I was not prompted to sign into github from android studio, instead I had to create a token then linked it to android studio. I then commited the changes to github. 
When using the command line for git, I also ran into a few issues with pushing the walkthrough gif to my repo, I had to use my token as my github password, then force the changes onto my repo to get it to push (it completely replaced my remote repo with the one from the local drive).
I am using Linux and am not sure if this is a linux thing or for everyone.
